<h1 align="center">Pharos Computers</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://connorfriday-code.github.io/Pharos-Computers/)

Pharos Computers is a website based on a real shop in my local town, intending to spread information about its services and direct customers towards the shop. It is designed to be readable on all types of media, with the design subtly changing to match the different widths of different devices. The content will be fairly simple and describe problems in broad terms. Not only is this to keep text bloat as small as possible to increase readability, but if a customer is looking for technical help for their computer, then chances are technical terms will only confuse and deter them.

The owner of the shop has permitted me to make a website based on his shop.

<h2 align="center">Design</h2>

<h3>Layout</h3>

The layout will be simple to keep readers on track. Using clear content blocks and colours, I can direct a customer's eyes to contact details and service information.

<h3>Features</h3>
The website needs to be adaptive to different screen sizes.

The website needs to be quick to navigate.

It needs to have a functioning form section.

The website needs to be as accessible as possible to those with disabilities.

<h3>Wireframes</h3>

<h4>Phone wireframes</h4>

<h4>Computer wireframe</h4>

![Computer services wireframe](readme-images/wireframes/computer-service.png)

![Computer contact wireframe](readme-images/wireframes/computer-contact.png)

<h4>Navigation</h4>

The navigation will use bold colours and hard blocks to stand out on the page.

<h4>Footer</h4>

It will mirror the colours and blockiness of the navigation, yet will keep itself simple to avoid drawing the user's attention away from the page's content.

<h4>Landing page</h4>

The landing page will have a large hero element to draw the user's attention to it, where they will find the store's phone number. This is for both returning users and new users. Returning users are likely already sold on the service and want to simply contact the store as quickly as possible. For new users, this is to immediately put the information of where the shop's number is, so if they're convinced already on the welcome directly below they can immediately use it without having to search for it. Alternatively, new users might have been recommended by a friend, and as such will already be sold on the service and will want to be able to call the store for further questions as quickly as possible.

Below the hero image will be a brief welcome and the shop owner's image. The purpose of these is to quickly create a friendly, honest atmosphere for the user. The welcome message will also briefly state what the store does and where it offers its services.

At the bottom will be a review, to once again help create a sensation of trust from the website and the store's services.

<h4>Services page</h4>

Once again a large hero-like image takes the front and centre to keep consistency across the pages. This hero image is a carousel whose purpose is to briefly and quickly explain the services the store offers.

The second section below it is meant to expand on this and explain in greater detail what the shop does and the services it provides.

The reviews are again there to create a feeling of trust with the user for the store.

<h4>Contact page</h4>

A large iframe embed of a Google Map mimics the hero image and carousel of the other two pages. The purpose of it is to simply show exactly where the store is on a map.

Below it is another image of the store and a table of open/closed times during the week, an address, and a phone number again. The image is the same one as the hero image but without a grey background darkening it, and the purpose of it is to present what the store looks like from the street for those looking for it. The address is physically typed out as a redundancy in case the user has any problems with Google Maps. The open and closed times during the week are to inform the user when they can call/enter the store.

Finally, the form is there for those who wish to email the store, in case they wish to message the store but don't have a phone and/or the store is closed at the time, without having to copy/paste an email address and leave the site to do so.

<h3>Colour</h3>

![Logo of store](readme-images/Pahros-Computers-Logo.jpg)

Using the logo of the shop (posted above), the main colours shall be white, dark blue, and bright yellow.

For contrast and easy readability, a white background with standard black text is used. The yellow was a great choice for anything related to links or contacting the store, due to the colour theory of yellow representing "purchase" or "service". Dark blue and white have a great contrast, thus would work great for the header/footer to make it stand out from the page's content.

<h3>Content</h3>

Most people using the website will not be tech literate, and seeing how they're looking for computer support for one reason or another, will likely not be using their computer and instead mobile devices. As such, content needs to be small and easy to navigate, with the language used to explain topics kept as simple as possible. Every piece of content should fill a role: explaining the store, explaining the services, and explaining how to contact the store.

<h2 align="center">Testing</h2>

<h3>During development/bug fixing</h3>

<h4>Nav section on large screens</h4>

On the planned wireframe I had the navigation on large screens to be three links split horizontally, however, I encountered a problem with this. The col-2 spacing did not leave a lot of room. On a standard widescreen, this was not a problem, but when the screen width shrunk down the words would end up overlaying one another before it would switch to the dropdown button for small screens. See the images below.

Old lg nav (right side) on normal full-width screen:

![Nav lg old fullscreen](readme-images/phaross-computers-lg-nav-problem-1.png)

Old lg nav (right side) on a screen with a smaller than standard width:

![Nav lg old smaller width](readme-images/phaross-computers-lg-nav-problem-2.png)

I, therefore, decided to keep accessibility across different screen sizes to layer the three navigation links vertically instead of horizontally.

New lg nav (right side) on normal full-width screen:

![Nav lg new fullscreen](readme-images/phaross-computers-lg-nav-problem-4.png)

New lg nav (right side) on a screen with a smaller than standard width:

![Nav lg new smaller width](readme-images/phaross-computers-lg-nav-problem-3.png)

<h4>Logo on small screens</h4>

On the planned wireframe for small devices, I had planned for the: logo, header/title, and nav bar to all fit in the navigation bar. I was hesitant due to the size of the logo if it would end up being squished, however, and was hoping to see if reducing the size of the navigation menu would allow it to fit. The dropdown menu was not enough though and the logo does end up being squished and/or offscreen on small screens.

![Nav lg with no logo squish](readme-images/phaross-computers-logo-problem-lg.png)

![Nav sm with logo squish](readme-images/phaross-computers-logo-problem-sm.png)

This also raised another problem. With the logo and website header/title in front of me, I could see the redundancy of the business name appearing in both the logo and the header.

This led to me deciding to remove the title/header on mobile to remove redundancy and create room for the logo.

![Nav lg with h1 title](readme-images/phaross-computers-logo-problem-lg-2.png)

![Nav sm with h1 removed](readme-images/phaross-computers-logo-problem-sm-2.png)

<h3>Lighthouse testing</h3>

<H4>Index page</H4>

![Lighthouse index](readme-images/index-lighthouse.png)

<H4>Services page</H4>

![Lighthouse services](readme-images/services-lighthouse.png)

<H4>Contact page</H4>

![Lighthouse contact](readme-images/contact-lighthouse.png)

<h4>Performance</h4>

The largest reason why performance in all three lighthouse pages is low is due to images being excessively large and increasing load times. It is noted in the bugs/future development to resize the images to decrease load time.

<h3>Git</h3>

The site was deployed to GitHub pages through the steps as follows:

<ol>
<li>In the GitHub repository is the settings tab</li>
<li>In the new page there will be a menu on the left with one option being 'Pages'</li>
<li>Within this I selected the branch to be 'Main', and refreshing the page a minute later it had updated with a ribbon display to indicate success</li>
</ol>
