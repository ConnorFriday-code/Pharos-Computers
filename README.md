<h1 align="center">Pharos Computers</h1>

Pharos Computers is a website based on a real shop in my local town, with the goal to spread information about its services and direct customers towards the shop. It is designed to be readable on all types of media, with the desgin subtly changing to match the different widths of different devices. The content will be fairly simple and describe problems in broad terms. Not only is this to keep text-bloat as small as possible to increase readability, but if a customer is looking for technical help for their computer, then chances are technical terms will only confuse and deter them.

The owner of the shop has given me permission to make a website based on his shop.

<h4>Navigation</h4>

The navgation will use bold colours and hard blocks to stand out on the page.

<h4>Footer</h4>

It will mirror the colours and blockiness of the navigation, yet will keep itself simple to not draw the user's attention away from the pages content.

<h4>Landing page</h4>

The landing page will have a large hero element to draw the user's attention to it, where they will find the store's phone number. This is for both returning users and new users. For returning users, they are likely already sold on the service and want to simply contact the store as quick as possible. For new users, this is to immediately put the information of where the shop's number is, so if they're sold already on the welcome directly below they can immediately use it without having to search for. Alternatively, new users might have been recommended by a friend, and as such will already be sold on the service and will want to be able call the store for further questions as quickly as possible.

Below the hero image will be a brief welcome and the shop owner's image. The purpose of these is to quickly create a friendly, honest atmosphere to the user. The welcome message will also briefly state what the store does and where they offer their services to.

At the bottom will be a review, to once again help create a sensation of trust from the website and the store's services.

<h4>Contact page</h4>

<h3>Colour</h3>

Using the logo of the shop (found here), the main colours shall be: white, dark blue, green, and bright yellow.
For contrast and easy readability, a white background with standard black/charcol coloured text is used. The yellow was a great choice for anything related to contact, due to the standard colour theory of yellow meaning "purchase" or "service".

<h4>Nav section on large screens</h4>

On the planned wireframe I had the navigation on large screens to be three links split horizontally, however, I encounted a problem with this. The col-2 spacing did not leave a lot of room. On standard wide screen this was not a problem, but when the screen width shrunk down, the words would end up overlaying one another before it would switch to the dropdown button for small screens. See images below.

Old lg nav (right side) on normal full width screen:

![Nav lg old fullscreen](readme-images/Phaross%20computers%20lg%20nav%20problem%201.PNG)

Old lg nav (right side) on a screen with a smaller than standard width:

![Nav lg old smaller width](readme-images/Phaross%20computers%20lg%20nav%20problem%202.PNG)

I, therefore, decided to keep accessability across different screen sizes to layer the three navigation links vertically instead of horizontally.

New lg nav (right side) on on normal full width screen:

![Nav lg new fullscreen](readme-images/Phaross%20computers%20lg%20nav%20problem%204.PNG)

New lg nav (right side) on a screen with smaller than standard width:

<h4>Logo on small screens</h4>

On the planned wireframe for small devices, I had planned for the: logo, header/title, and nav bar to all fit in the navigation bar. I was hesistant due to the size of the logo if it would end up being squished, however, and was hoping to see if reducing the size of the navigation menu would allow it to fit. The dropdown menu was not enough though and the logo does end up being squished, overlaying, and/or offscreen on small screens.

This also raised another problem. With the logo and website header/title in front of me, I could see the redundency of the buisness name appearing in both the logo and in the header.

This led me to deciding to remove the title/header on mobile to remove redundency and create room for the logo.
